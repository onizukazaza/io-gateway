  <h3>Archive notice</h3>
  <span style="font-size: 20px;">Propose an IoT project that has the ability to communicate data between a microcontroller board to a microcontroller board with a web application server as a Gateway.</span>
    <p>As of now (February 2024) this code is still functional and has reached a high level of maturity thanks to all your input in more than 100 closed issues and 50 pull requests. I have archived this repository due to a shift in priorities. Thanks for using this project, and keep building and making!</p>

  <p>The ESP8266 IoT Framework is a set of modules to be used as a starting point in new ESP8266 projects, implementing HTTPS requests, a React web interface, WiFi manager, configuration manager, live dashboard, and OTA updates.</p>

  <p>The unique advantage of this framework is that code generation at build time is used to provide different benefits. Code generation is used to dynamically generate a configuration struct and a live dashboard from JSON files, to incorporate the web interface into PROGMEM in the firmware, and to bundle a full root certificate store in PROGMEM that allows the ESP8266 to do secure HTTPS requests to arbitrary URLs.</p>
